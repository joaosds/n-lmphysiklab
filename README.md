## Course Overview

This is a hands-on 5-day block course exploring how simple language models can learn and generate physics trajectories from non-Markovian generalized Langevin dynamics.

## Course Structure

- **Date:** February 9-13, 2026
- **Time:** 09:30-12:00 daily

## Materials

- **Manual (`manual_v1.pdf`):** Contains all course information, theory, problem sets, and further references
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Each day includes a companion notebook for hands-on exercises

## Tentative Schedule

- **Day 1:** Fully connected and convolutional neural networks 
- **Day 2:** PCA and n-gram language models
- **Day 3:** Langevin dynamics (standard and generalized)
